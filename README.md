# Yelp

This project is a repdocution of the Yelp mobile application using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

## User Stories

- [ ] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [ ] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [ ] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
